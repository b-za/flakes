# Introduction

Create a flake that has a ok Neovim setup

Eventually create a flake for every app that I use that has configs

Then just import those flakes into the darwin or home manager configs

Add all the flakes into one github repo unless there is some reason to have separate repos

keet the flakes repo at Ëœ/.flakes on my systems.

everything is a flake even the main system config

# Flakes

Flakes lock the versions of packages in at the version they where when the command was ran. 
So even if using the unstable channel the package versions will stay locked at the versions in the flake.lock file

## Creating a flake

in the folder you want the flake to be in

```bash
nix flake init 
```

## Example flake

```nix
{
  description = "my epic vims collection";

  inputs = {
      nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    # devShells means if the flake is a shells you can run it with
    # nix develop
    # instead of
    # nix develop .#bob
    devShells.${system}.default =
      pkgs.mkShell
        {
          buildInputs = [
            pkgs.neovim
            pkgs.vim
          ];

          shellHook = ''
            echo "hello mom"
          '';
        };
    bob =
      pkgs.mkShell
        {
          buildInputs = [
            pkgs.neovim
            pkgs.vim
          ];

          shellHook = ''
            echo "hello mom"
          '';
        };
  };
}
```

## Running a flake

In the folder the flake is in

```bash
nix develop
nix develop .#bob
```

Maybe the nix develop has something to do with devShells.${system}.default?

???? Note sure what this does Running a flake
```
nix run 
```

## Updating a flake

Updated the versions of the inputs in the flake

In the folder the flake is in

```bash
nix flake update
```
