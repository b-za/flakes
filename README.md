# Introduction

Create a flake that has a ok Neovim setup

Eventually create a flake for every app that I use that has configs

Then just import those flakes into the darwin or home manager configs

Add all the flakes into one github repo unless there is some reason to have separate repos

keet the flakes repo at Ëœ/.flakes on my systems.

everything is a flake even the main system config

# Core Nix components

## Nix

A build tool and package manager used to create declarative, reproducible software systems.

https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix

## Nix language

A language for instructing Nix how to build packages, environments, and systems.

https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nix-language

## NixOS

A Linux distribution built on Nix with its core principles in mind.

https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/nixos

## Nixpkgs

A vast collection of Nix packages, libraries, and helper functions.

# Flakes

Flakes lock the versions of packages in at the version they where when the command was ran. 
So even if using the unstable channel the package versions will stay locked at the versions in the flake.lock file

## Creating a flake

in the folder you want the flake to be in

```bash
nix flake init 
```

## Example flake

```nix
{
  description = "my epic vims collection";

  inputs = {
      nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs }:
  let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    # devShells means if the flake is a shells you can run it with
    # nix develop
    # instead of
    # nix develop .#bob
    devShells.${system}.default =
      pkgs.mkShell
        {
          buildInputs = [
            pkgs.neovim
            pkgs.vim
          ];

          shellHook = ''
            echo "hello mom"
          '';
        };
    bob =
      pkgs.mkShell
        {
          buildInputs = [
            pkgs.neovim
            pkgs.vim
          ];

          shellHook = ''
            echo "hello mom"
          '';
        };
  };
}
```

## Testing a flake

In the folder the flake is in

```bash
nix develop
nix develop .#bob
```

Maybe the nix develop has something to do with devShells.${system}.default?

## Building a flake

```bash
nix flake build?? 
```

## See available nix run targets

```bash
nix flake show github:DeterminateSystems/riff
```

## Running a flake

In the folder the flake is in

???? Note sure what this does Running a flake
```
nix flake run??
nix run "https://flakehub.com/f/NixOS/nixpkgs/*#ponysay"

```

## Updating a flake

Updated the versions of the inputs in the flake

In the folder the flake is in

```bash
nix flake update
```

# Important Tools

## github:numtide/flake-utils

Pure Nix flake utility functions.

The goal of this project is to build a collection of pure Nix functions that don't depend on nixpkgs, and that are useful in the context of writing other Nix flakes.

https://github.com/numtide/flake-utils

Example
$ examples/each-system/flake.nix as nix

```nix
{
  description = "Flake utils demo";

  inputs.flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}; in
      {
        packages = rec {
          hello = pkgs.hello;
          default = hello;
        };
        apps = rec {
          hello = flake-utils.lib.mkApp { drv = self.packages.${system}.hello; };
          default = hello;
        };
      }
    );
}
```

Has lots of good content to learn Nix in general, even though it seems like the focus is on NixOS and not Nix-Darwin I think many of the configuration options are similar.

- Setting up home manager using flakes
- standalone and as part of nixos
- seems like the main difference between stand alone and linked to os is that
  - it can be build separately
  - you do not need to use sudo when rebuilding if its stand alone
  - it can be used on other systems if it is stand alone
- the main reason i can think why stand alone is not good is making sure the package versions are the same between the system and the home user
